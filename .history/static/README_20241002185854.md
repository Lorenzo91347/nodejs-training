Instruction to self:

to run the mock server and then the app,do as following:

1. in a powerShell Terminal, in the mock-srv folder,
run "npm run start".
2. in a second terminal, run "npm run dev"
3. in a third terminal, run "npm run static"

Tried to use the Serve package,but for some reason
it refuses to run
